# Java_Dealership
Create an interactive Java application that uses if-elseif-else statements, as well as switch statements.

## Step 1: 

We need to ask the user whether they want to buy a car or sell us their car:

```java
System.out.println(" - Select option 'a' to buy a car.");
System.out.println(" - Select option 'b' to sell a car.");
```

We need to save the response in a variable for later use:

```java
String option = scan.nextLine();
```
